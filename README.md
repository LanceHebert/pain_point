# Pain Point

## Description

- Made in 3 weeks, Solo Capstone Project 

This project is an attempt to provide a learning resource to help avoid the most common pain sites I dealt with during my tenure as a physical therapist. The design goals of this website were to make a responsive website that could be sent to your mom,dad,grandparents or anyone else who you feel might need a set of physical therapist approved exercises to avoid common injury. This design choice led to bigger buttons, a cool color design theory to improve user trust and simpler layout for ease of use.
